bio: I’m Ângela Coelho, a frontend developer and digital designer with a special interest in web development, creative coding, and generative design. I studied Design and Multimedia for five years at the University of Coimbra in Portugal and I’ve been working as a frontend developer for the past few years. During this time, the main focus of my explorations relied on the role of design in the technological world and how code can create meaningful and astonishing experiences. I enjoy most building immersive audio and visual experiences with appealing visuals, interactions, and animations. My goal is to keep exploring my two main areas of interest — programming and design —, to find new points of connection and take advantage of each one of them in the field of creative coding.

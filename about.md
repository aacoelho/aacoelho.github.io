bio: I’m Ângela Coelho, a digital designer with a special interest in web development and generative design. I graduated in Design and Multimedia in the end of 2016 at the University of Coimbra in Portugal. During my five years of study, I was able to try different things, so the main focus of my explorations relied on the role of design in the technological world and how code can influence and shape the design process. In the last few months, I’ve been working as a web designer and front-end developer and now I continue to explore the area of experimental digital design. My goal is to keep exploring my two main areas of interest — design and programming —, in order to find new points of connection between these fields as well as taking advantage of each one of them so I can improve my skills and develop  ways to solve design problems.

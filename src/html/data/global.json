    "bio": "Hi! I’m Ângela Coelho, a recently Design and Multimedia graduated student at the University of Coimbra. After five years of studying, I started to work as a web designer and front-end developer, and occasionally graphic designer. Currently, I'm working on a Portuguese startup called HYP. I like to explore code applied to design solutions, trying to join these two main areas of interest."

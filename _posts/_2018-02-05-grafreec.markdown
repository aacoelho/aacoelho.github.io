description: Grafreec is a website that provides, everyday, a new free graphic material that can be used in any context, both personal and commercial. The main concept for this project was the exploration of the four different areas each one associated with a different color. When one area is chosen the main theme color of the website switches to the area color. The different areas can also connect between each other, which is represented by a gradient with the main colors of each classification.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

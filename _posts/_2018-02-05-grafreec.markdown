description: Grafreec is a website created by HYP that provides a new free graphic material every day, which can be used in any context, both personal and commercial. The main concept for the development of this project was the exploration of four different areas, each one associated with a different colour. When an area is chosen, the websiteâ€™s main theme colour switches to the area colour. The different areas can also be interconnected by showing a gradient with the main colours of each classification.

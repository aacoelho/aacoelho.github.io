description: ​Development of the <a class='f_textBig-link' target='_blank' href='https://superhuit.ch/en/'>Superhuit​</a> website, a branding and digital design agency that offers graphic design, branding, UI/UX design, and web development solutions. The goal was to create a new website that reflected the agency's rebranding with the recourse of different levels of animation. It contains dedicated pages to explain the services, the developed projects, the team, and a blog with relevant articles. Besides that, it also includes a visual experience page that uses mouse interactions and illustrations to show the company’s culture. I was in charge of developing the frontend of the website, including the various animations. Project developed while working with <a class='f_textBig-link' target='_blank' href='https://superhuit.ch/en/'>Superhuit​</a>.

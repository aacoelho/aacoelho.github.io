description: Poster created for the 6th college theatre show <i>Até já!</i>, organised by the drama students from Coimbra Education School in Portugal. The  show consisted in a series of small plays and exercises  where the students had to create and direct a small  play with their  colleagues as actors. The main idea for the poster was to reflect the role of the students  in the creation of this show. In this way, pieces of photographs of each student were used to create a fictional character, and that is the main element of the poster.

description: Periferia is a modular typeface made from shapes collected in Choupal National Forest, located in the suburbs of Coimbra, Portugal. Choupal, once the theme of songs and poems, is now a forgotten place in the city and its existence threatened. This typeface pays tribute to this location and to all the other abandoned areas in the suburbs of Coimbra. The development of the typeface was based in four modules taken from the different shapes of the objects present in the forest. The rearrangement of these modules produces each one of the typeface characters.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

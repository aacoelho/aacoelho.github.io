description: Periferia is a modular typeface made from shapes collected in Choupal National Forest, located in the suburbs of Coimbra, Portugal. Choupal, once the theme of songs and poems, is now a forgotten place in the city and its existence is threatened. This typeface pays tribute to this location and to all the other abandoned areas in the suburbs of Coimbra. The development of the typeface was based in four modules taken from the different shapes of  objects present in the forest. The rearrangement of these modules produced each one of the typeface characters.

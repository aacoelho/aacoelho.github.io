description: Poster created for the 6th college theatre exhibition <i>Até já!</i>, organised by the theatre students from the Coimbra Education School in Portugal. The main idea for this poster was to reflect the participation role of each student in this project. The exhibition consists in the presentation of a series of small pieces and exercises done by each student, who had the role to create and direct a small piece and where the fellow colleagues appear as actors. The main idea was for the poster reflect the participation of the students to create this exhibition. In this way were used photographic pieces of each student to create a fictional character that is the main object of the poster.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

description: Mobile game conceived and developed by HYP, that consists in guessing a song hummed (trauteada) by another player. A player can challenge another player or friend, select from a pack of songs a song to hum and send his creation to be guessed by his opponent. Each player gains points if his creation is correctly guessed or if he guesses the song of another player correctly. The idea explored for the design of the application was to incorporate the illustrations already made and create fluid and light screens for the game.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

title:  "The world around women"
type: "Exhibition design"
description: Academic group project to conceive an interactive exhibition about women in design. The exhibition – The world around women – presents the work of 8 different designers from distant places on the globe, and also presents facts and news of their countries about the gender inequality suffered by women. Since the country is the common subject between the designers and the facts presented, all the identity of the exhibition is based in the flag colors of the different countries represented with stripes. The colored stripe is, in this way, the visual element that connects all the rooms in the exhibition and sets the tone to the approach for all the graphic material developed. The exhibition is complemented by an application that uses augmented reality to show further information about each designer and country.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].

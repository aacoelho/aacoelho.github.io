description: Polis is an application that intends to engage the citizens to participate in the decisions of his country, city, company, school or any other institution he belongs to, by creating a voting system that allows the user to give is opinion and to see the general public decision. This application makes possible for the user to approve and disapprove ideas that can be added to the application by a another citizen, a deputy or another entity, which makes possible to collect the public opinion outside the standard voting system. This project consisted in the development of the brand and the UX/UI design of the application screens.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
